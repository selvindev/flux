### Description
Fluent Regular Expressions _in_ PHP inspired by and largely based on

*@see inspiration & credits below for more info.*

### Requirements
- PHP 5.3
- Composer

### Install
`Flux` is available as a [package](https://packagist.org/packages/selvinortiz/flux) via [composer](http://getcomposer.org)

* require: `"selvinortiz/flux": "dev-master"`
* autoload: `require_once 'path/to/vendor/autoload.php'`
* namespace: `use SelvinOrtiz\Utils\Flux\Flux;`
* instantiate: `$flux = Flux::getInstance();`

_You can additionally clone/download this repo and do whatever you want: )_

----

### @Example
This simple example illustrates the way you would use `flux` and it's fluent interface to build complex patterns.

```php
require_once realpath(__DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php');

use SelvinOrtiz\Utils\Flux\Flux;
use SelvinOrtiz\Utils\Flux\Helper;

// The subject string (URL)
$str	= 'http://www.selvinortiz.com';

// Bulding the pattern (Fluently)
$flux	= Flux::getInstance()
		->startOfLine()
		->find('http')
		->maybe('s')
		->then('://')
		->maybe('www.')
		->anythingBut('.')
		->either('.co', '.com')
		->ignoreCase()
		->endOfLine();

// Output the Flux instance
Helper::dump( $flux );

// Output the fluently built pattern (@see /src/SelvinOrtiz/Utils/Flux/Helper)
Helper::msg( $flux ); // /^(http)(s)?(\:\/\/)(www\.)?([^\.]*)(.co|.com)$/i

// Inspect the results
Helper::msg( $str );
Helper::msg( $flux->match( $str ) ? 'matched' : 'unmatched' );
Helper::msg( $flux->replace( 'https://$5$6', $str ) );
```

### FLUX API
The **flux** API was designed to give you a _fluent chainable object_ to build patterns with.

#### `startOfLine()`
Adds a beginning of line `^` modifier

#### `endOfLine()`
Adds an end of line `$` modifier

#### `find( $val ) & then( $val )`
Allows you to augment the pattern with a required `segment` and it escapes regular expression characters

#### `maybe( $val )`
Allows you to augment the pattern with an optional `segment`

#### `any( $val ) & anyOf( $val )`
Allows you to create a set of characters to match

#### `anything()`
Adds a *wild card* `(.*)` `segment` to the pattern but it does not make `dotAll()` explicit

#### `anythingBut( $val )`
Will match anything but the characters in `$val` which is opposite of `any()` and `anyOf`

#### `br() & lineBreak()`
Allows you to match a new line `(DOS/Unix)`

#### `tab()`
Adds a `(\t)` to the pattern which will match a tab

#### `word()`
Adds `(\w+)` to the pattern which will match a single word

#### `letters( $min=null, $max=null )`
Only matches characters in the alphabet and uses `$min` and `$max` to create a quantifier

#### `digits( $mix=null, $max=null )`
Only matches digits and uses `$min` and `$max` to create a quantifier like `word()`

#### `range( $from, $to [, $from, $to ...])`
Allows you to create a `range` character class like `a-z0-9` by calling `range('a', 'z', 0, 9)`

#### `orTry( $val='' )`
Allows you to create OR cases `(this)|(else)` and retain the capturing order to use in `replace()`

#### `ignoreCase() & inAnyCase()`
Adds the `i` modifier to the pattern which will allow you to match in a case insensitive manner

#### `matchNewLine() & dotAll()`
Adds the `s` modifier to the pattern which will allow you to match a `new line` when using `anything()`

#### `multiline()`
Adds the `m` modifier to the pattern which will allow you to search across multiple lines

#### `oneLine() & searchOneLine()`
Removes the modifier added by `multiline()` if it was previously called

#### `match( $subject )`
Simply takes your `$subject` in, compares it against the pattern, and returns whether a it matched or not

#### `replace( $replacement, $subject )`
You can replace matched `segments` by using the `$x` format where `x` is the `(int)` position of the matched `segment`

#### `getPattern()`
Returns the compiled pattern which you can also get by using the `flux` instance in a context where `__toString()` will be called

#### `clear()`
Clears the created `pattern` along with the `modifiers`, `prefixes`, and `suffixes`

----

### Flux Elsewhere
There is a straight port of *Flux* for [NodeJS](https://npmjs.org/package/node-flux) _by_ [James Brooks](http://james.brooks.so) whom has also collaborated on this project.

### Inspiration & Credits
This project is inspired and largely based on
[VerbalExpressions:JS](https://github.com/jehna/VerbalExpressions) by
[Jesse Luoto](https://plus.google.com/u/0/101155583332851062944/posts)
whom on *July 20, 2013* started a weekend project that generated a lot of interest in the developer community and that project has proven to have a lot of potential.

*Flux* is not a straight port of *VerbalExpressions* but if you're interested in a straight *VerbalExpressions* port for *PHP* you should checkout
[VerbalExpressions:PHP](https://github.com/markwilson/VerbalExpressionsPhp) by
[Mark Wilson](https://github.com/markwilson)

*VerbalExpressions* has also been ported to `Ruby`, `Java`, `Groovy` as of this update (July 25, 2013).

*For a little background as to why _flux_ was created and why you should use it, please refer to* [Issue #7](https://github.com/selvinortiz/flux/issues/7)
*for a discussion on that matter.*

### MIT License
*Flux* is released under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) which pretty much means you can do with it as you please and I won't get mad because I'm that nice; )
